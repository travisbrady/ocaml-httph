# ocaml-httph
Minimal OCaml bindings to the [httpserver.h](https://github.com/jeremycw/httpserver.h) http server toolkit

## Summary
This library provides a _very_ minimal set of OCaml bindings to the httpserver.h header file. 
The advantage of this library is the underlying library is non-blocking, compact and reasonaby fast given my testing so far.

## Benchmarks
See [BENCH.md](/bench.md) for a start

## Alpha Notice
This is not production software, more of an experiment really.
