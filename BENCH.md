# BENCH

Some simple early benchmarking mostly to determine if results within OCaml match
those purely using the C example.


Here we use the [hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) http load generator because I have it
and it seems to work pretty well. You could also use wrk2 if you prefer that.

```
$ hey -n 20000 -c 20 http://127.0.0.1:8080/plaintext
